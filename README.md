<br>
Brainstormingideas:
- Place a few portable recorders at various places in the University, record the ambience of that space. Record for approximately 10 minutes in total (it can be 2.30mins for 4 consecutive days). Bounce the recorder audio in a DAW and create a composition by only using the recorded sound.
- Record my colleagues checking in guests and use the vocal samples for a composition.
- Record some natural human functions (sneezing, coughing etc.) and use them as part of a composition.
- Choose either of these ideas or merge them all into one aiming for an aesthetically nice outcome.
