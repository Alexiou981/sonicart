<br>
Brainstorming ideas:
<br>
- Place a few portable recorders at various places in the University, record the ambience of that space. Record for approximately 10 minutes in total (it can be 2.30mins for 4 consecutive days). Bounce the recorder audio in a DAW and create a composition by only using the recorded sound.
<br>
- Record my colleagues checking in guests and use the vocal samples for a composition.
<br>
- Record some natural human functions (sneezing, coughing etc.) and use them as part of a composition.
<br>
- Choose either of these ideas or merge them all into one aiming for an aesthetically nice outcome.
<br>
<br>

Week 2
<br>
todo:
- Find a way to make all these three ideas work together as one project.
- Think about/research on how you can get good quality recording out of a portable recorder.
